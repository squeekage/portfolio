                <p>
                    I have been a web developer for almost 10 years, mostly specializing in ASP.NET.
                    I got my degree in Psychology from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2005. Programming was actually a hobby of mine
                    while I was in college. I started doing basic web development with HTML and then moved on to JavaScript and CSS and eventually PHP and
                    MySQL. By the time I had figured out that I might like a career in programming I was already nearly done with my degree.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I got a temp job out of college at a clothing retailer, Tilly's'. And while I was there I did things like set up databases and generate
                    monthly buying reports, which greatly impressed my managers. I was quickly moved to the e-commerce department and hired on full time.
                    I started learning C# and I gradually started taking on larger and larger projects for the website. Before long I architected a major
                    overhaul of website backend, replacing a frequently malfuntioning implementation of Microsoft's Commerce Server with a fully customized
                    propietary solution. By the end of my tenure at Tilly's I was in charge of the entire e-commerce website as well as all supporting
                    applications, both web and desktop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After Tilly's I moved to the Bay Area and started work at Fox Head. While there I was in charge of the web services that helped all of
                    their third party systems communicate with each other. I also supported their B2B website, EDI order implementation and the internal IT
                    ticketing system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After Fox I took a break from my career for 8 years to start and raise my family. In the last several months, in preparation for my
                    return to the workforce, I started a personal website for my family. Every year my parents and and siblings do a Secret Santa gift
                    exchange at Christmas. Normally the whole thing is manually managed by my mom, which means that she always knows who has her and
                    everyone goes to her to figure out what their assigned person would like. My website automates all of that. People are given assignments,
                    can generate and maintain a wish list, and can anonymously message their assigned person. They can also opt out of the gift exchange and
                    manage wish lists for their kids.
